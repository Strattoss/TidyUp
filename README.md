# Tidy up!
Tidy up! is a simple game inspired by the [Garfield game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_(video_game)). Despite the extremely negative reception, the game and its concept remain close to my heart, as it was one of my favorite games in my childhood.

The goal of this project is to create a game based on the mechanics of Garfield, but with a twist.
